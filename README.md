# COVID-19 Data from John Hopkins University

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that took the world by storm early 2020. It is a respiratory disease that we have not been exposed to before. The speed at which it spread and how contagious it was quickly made it a global pandemic. As a result, life is very different now with many new safety procedures and protocols in place. Though we are working hard battling this pandemic, it is unlikely that we will return to our regular lives anytime soon.

In this analysis, we will analyze the number of confirmed cases and number of deaths within the United States as well as on a global scale. We can look at the correlation between these numbers to determine if this disease has a high or low mortality rate. We will also look to see which countries are at the top of the list for both categories.
